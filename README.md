# Client / Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindui.com/documentation).\
This project uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

## Prefix

To get the project started, make sure you have _npm_ installed on your computer. Npm is a package manager, which downloads the necessary packages into this directory for the project to run.

After having downloaded npm (`npm -v` in the terminal should now give you your npm version), please run `npm install`in the directory. This command will run all the necessary packages, as provided in the package.json file.

Now, your directory should have a `node_modules` folder. You should not worry about it, or even really open it. node_modules essentially stores all the packages / code necessary for this project to run. Now, you can start your project!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Server / Backend

This backend is made with node.js, using express. It is written using typescript, with prisma as a database ORM.

## Setting up

To start the server up, you have to have npm on your computer, then in the server directory, install the necessary packages using `npm install`.

### Database

To get the database running, you must first have an instance of a database to connect to. For this project, we are using Sqlite. If you open up your .env file, you will see that we link to a sqlite file that you might not yet have.

1. To create your sqlite (.db) file, please run `npx prisma db push`. This command will update your database to match the prisma schema, which can be found in the _./prisma_ folder, which your _dev.db_ file should also be after running the above mentioned command.
   1.1 As this command also updates the db schema to match the prisma schema, you must run this command after any changes to _schema.prisma_. If you update it, please include it in your commit message, to let others know to update theirs as well.

2. You can run `prisma generate`to generate a prisma client to connect to our database, but it isn't necessary. I haven't even tried it. I recommend using the Sqlite extension on VSCode marketplace, right-clicking the _dev.db_ file, and pressing "open database".

**To seed the database with initial data, use `npx prisma db seed` inside the _/backend_ directory. This command will fill the database with seed data, found in _./prisma/seed.ts_.
If that fails, run `npx prisma db push` and then the previous command.
If that fails, run `npm install`, then both previous commands.
If that fails, get help.**

### Server

Now, you can start the server in development mode using `npm run dev`, or in production mode using `npm start`.

If problems arise, or if setting up is difficult or unclear, let Krist√≥fer know or add to this readme file.

## Testing:

For testing, we use _jest_, a testing package for javascript. As we are testing http endpoints, we decide to test with _supertest_, which allows us to call the endpoints for the tests.

The tests are inside the _/test_ folder. To run them, make sure that the server is up (either with `npm run dev` or `npm start`), then in another terminal, call `npm test`. This will run all the test files in the _/test_ folder with jest.

#### [Using typescript with Express](https://youtu.be/qy8PxD3alWw)

Includes:

- Setting up typescript with node (tsc, typescript, @types/node and @types/express)
- Npm scripts and packages for hot reloading (rimraf, concurrently)

### [Express with typescript and Prisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM58NEMJgMw)

Includes:

- Typescript config (tsconfig.json)
- dotenv functionality with typescript (dotenv, @types/dotenv)
- Prisma client, schema, and sqlite db.
  - Note that _esbuild-register_ from the video did not work in this project. Rather, _ts-node_ was used for seeding.
